## Lab1

This is the code for 4 serverless machine learning applications that use
2 well-known ML datasets, the Iris dataset and the Titanic dataset.

The code for each datasets includes both the 2 pairs of feature/training python
files that need to be run locally with an Hopsworks & Modal account, and
2 folders containing the code that powers their respective huggingface spaces
online GUI, which can be found at the url detailed below.

In the `src` folder, you can find all the code for the two applications for each
dataset.

### 1. Iris

The code for this was already provided.

The resulting huggingface spaces can be found at:

1. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/Iris](https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/Iris)

2. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/iris-monitor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/iris-monitor)

### 2. Titanic

The resulting huggingface spaces can be found at:

1. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/Titanic-Prediction](https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/Titanic-Prediction)

2. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/titanic-monitor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/humeur/titanic-monitor)
